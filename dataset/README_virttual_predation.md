jnd_color_hum <- "just noticiable distance" units of colour between grasshoppers and background	
jnd_lum_hum <- "just noticiable distance" units of luminance between grasshoppers and background	
grasshopper_density <- density of grasshoppers in the screen
id_observer <- random nickname of the observer as identifier
