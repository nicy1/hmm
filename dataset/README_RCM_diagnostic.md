Improving diagnostic sensitivity of combined dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy imaging through double reader concordance evaluation in telemedicine settings: A retrospective study of 1000 equivocal cases.

Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an imaging device that permits non-invasive visualization of cellular morphology and has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopically equivocal cutaneous lesions.

Description of the variables:
-----------------------------

Case_Number: case id (numeric)
Actual_Diagnosis: diagnosis id (word)
Proposed_Management_with_RCM: EXCISION / NON EXCISION
Confidence_for_RCM_Management: CONFIDENCE / LOW CONFIDENCE
