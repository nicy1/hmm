This file selects the features to be used as observations and hidden states. It also splits the dataset in train (x_train: observations, y_train: hidden states) and test data (x_test: observations, y_test: hidden states as targets), 80% and 20% respectively.

The prediction accuracy of this model is 68.76% (with dataset "telepathology1.csv").
